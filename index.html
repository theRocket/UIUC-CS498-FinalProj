					<h2>CS 498 Data Visualization - Final Project</h2>
					<h3>The Impact of the Coal Economy on the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election</h3>
					<div style="text-align:left">
					<p>This narrative visualization is structured as an interactive slideshow. Each scene is presented with a title at the top of the slide, a U.S. map at the bottom, and a brief introduction to what the graphical data is trying to convey in the middle.</p>
					<p>Using the arrows at the bottom right of the scene, the viewer can navigate to the next slide, previous slide, or down to get more information on the topic presented. Once on a lower slide, the up arrow brings them back to the map. The arrows are annotated with the slide number and depth, such as 1.2 (slide 1, depth 2)</p>
						<p>For triggers, I provide a map of the U.S. with the option to hover over for more specific data displayed at the top of the map. It is cleared once the mouse leaves the map. With the click of a button, the viewer may zoom into the region in question or zoom back out to see the entire U.S. The state of the button changes accordingly.</p>
						<p>The parameters are the state or county the user points their mouse at which loads the state election and county coal employment data parameters.</p><p>The annotations are the corresponding election or coal employment data from loaded JSON files displayed above the map.</p>

						<h1>The Electoral College and &ldquo;Swing States&rdquo;</h1>
						<p>Donald Trump did not win the popular election for U.S. President in 2016. He won on electoral votes alone which has happened only four times in the history of electing 45 U.S. Presidents.</p><p>The key to this result is the phenomenon called Swing States. Whereas, from one Presidential election to the next, many states always or often result in either a Democratic or Republican win (also called their Traditional Strongholds), there are twelve states that can go either way depending on the hot button topics and prominent mood of the time. They are also called Battleground States, meaning where the battle can be won or lost.<p></p>Swing States that flipped from supporting Obama (Democrat) in 2012 to Trump (Republican) in 2016 (and their votes) were Iowa (6), Wisconsin (10), Ohio (18), and Pennsylvania (20). These would have been focused targets for the Trump team to win over with campaign promises.</p><p> For the purposes of this presentation, we will be zooming in on the two of that list with the most active coal mines - Ohio and Pennsylvania - which accounts for the majority of those electoral votes up for grabs out of the four states (38 out of 54 or 70%). Wisconsin and Iowa also do not have any significant coal mining activity so are not included in this analysis.</p>

						<p>Pennsylvania had not voted for a Republican president since voting for George H.W. Bush in 1988. Trump won there by 68,236 votes, netting him 20 electoral votes. Voter turnout increased by 6.3% and the shift to Republican support from 2012 to this election was 6.1% higher.</p><p>Ohio voted for Obama both times in the past two elections, 50.67% to Mitt Romney's 47.69% in 2012, and 51.38% to John McCain's 46.80% in 2008. The shift from Democrat to Republican in the popular vote from '12 to '16 increased 11.1% and Trump beat Hillary by 8.1%. The state earned him 18 electoral votes.<p></p>Trump won the presidency with 304 electoral votes and Hillary earned 227 where 270 are the minimum required to win. Flipping just these two states back to their former Democratic stance would have both candidates nearly tied in the overall race for electoral votes and neither victorious.<p>
